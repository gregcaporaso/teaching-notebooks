Teaching Notebooks
==================

This repository contains a collection of IPython Notebooks that I use for teaching, but which are not mature or interesting enough to go into other projects such as [An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics) or the [QIIME tutorials](https://github.com/biocore/qiime/tree/master/examples/ipynb). Some of these files may eventually migrate to those (or other) repositories.

More information
-----------------

These materials are primarily being developed by [Greg Caporaso](http://caporasolab.us/people/greg-caporaso/) (GitHub: [@gregcaporaso](https://github.com/gregcaporaso)) at [Northern Arizona University](http://www.nau.edu). You can find information on the courses I teach on [my teaching website](http://www.caporasolab.us/teaching) and information on my research and lab on [my lab website](http://www.caporasolab.us).

See the repository's [contributors page](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/graphs/contributors) for information on who has contributed to the project.
