      "Nucleic acid and protein sequences have an inherent orientation. The standard is to always write nucleic acid sequences from their ``5'`` (pronounced `five-prime`) end to their ``3'`` (pronounced `three-prime`) end and protein sequences from their N-terminus to their C-terminus. You should always do this, but if for some technical reason you can't (e.g., a figure in a paper that requires a specific orientation) you should make it very clear what the orientation is. A good way to write out nucleic acid sequences that explicitly incorporates the orientation of the sequence is like this:\n",
